"""Prediction-market data via Polymarket's public Gamma API. No API key required
for reading market data. We track a single market's implied YES probability over
time as the "price" series the momentum strategy operates on.

Gamma's markets endpoint only exposes the *current* price, not a rolling history,
so unlike the crypto/stock sources we build the series ourselves by persisting
each observed price locally and appending to it on every call. Momentum decisions
will be flat until enough real ticks have accumulated -- that's an accurate
reflection of not having history, not a bug to paper over.
